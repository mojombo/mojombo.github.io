# Important note

I was tired to deal with very complicated and over-engineered blog sites just to put my humble content in the air. Looking for a way to publish my projects and thoughts in the most minimalistic and easiest way as possible, I found [Tom's repo on Git](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io) and I imediately forked it and just made some minor adjustments in colors, text sizes and etc. If you like the blog-like-a-hacker style, it's thanks to Tom Preston-Werner.

# This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

I was tired of having my blog posts end up in a database off on some remote
server. That is backwards. I've lost valuable posts that way. I want to author
my posts locally in Textile or Markdown. My blog should be easily stylable and
customizable any way I please. It should take care of creating a feed for me.
And most of all, my site should be stored on GitHub so that I never lose data
again.
