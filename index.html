  <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
  		My name is Carl. I'm currently a 2014 Fellow at the University of Chicago's <a href="http://dssg.io">Data Science for Social Good</a> program. I'm going to be developing my statistics & computer science skills so that I can tackle important societal issues around poverty, health and education.
